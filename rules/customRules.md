Follow all this guidelines:

- Always use typescript
- Always use arrow function, even for component. Classes are only for singleton.
- Use axios rather than fetch
- Use react-query for all api calls
- Use tamagui if no design library is specified
- Use react-hook-form paired with yup when dealing with forms
- Don't put comment to explain what you did, write self-explanatory code
- Use expo for all react-native projects
- Prefer one line return when condition not meets
- If creating a repo that as more than one project, like front and back end, use turborepo
